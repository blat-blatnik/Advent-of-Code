# 2021

This was my first year participating. This was really fun!

I tried completing each day as it appeared - but I didn't really have time always so sometimes I did 2 or 3 days worth of challenges at once. In the end I managed to complete each day by the 25th :)

[Day 23](./day23.md) was the hardest for me by far. I just hate it when there's many rules to a game like this, I'm always worried that I missed a rule, or interpreted it wrongly or something. It took me almost 8 hours to get it working. And it's the last day I finished in the end.

[Day24](./day24.md) was strange. It was a reverse engineering puzzle or sorts, but I didn't want to solve it like that because I always tried to not look at the input at all and solve each day just based on what the instructions say. It turns out that it's possible to solve this day like that, but it takes an incredibly long time to run. I got sick of waiting for my python solution to finish (it takes more than 4 hours!) so I translated the code to C and it ran in only 5 minutes. This is the only day where I have both a python and a C solution.
